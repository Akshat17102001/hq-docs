Building an initial pool of relevant candidates is crucial, as it serves as the foundation for identifying the most ideal hires. To streamline this process, we offer a range of filters that help you efficiently create a highly relevant candidate pool from the start.

To create a highly relevant initial candidate pool, you can apply various filter attributes. Below are the available filters:

- **Locations**: Define specific geographic areas or postal codes to target candidates. Multiple locations can be added.

- **Years of Experience**: Set the required range of years of experience for the role.

- **Job Title**: Specify the ideal job title(s) candidates should have. You can also filter candidates based on whether they have held this title in their past roles.

- **Job Function**: Select the appropriate job function that aligns with the roleâ€™s responsibilities.


- **Keywords**: Enter relevant keywords to refine search results and identify the most suitable candidates.

- **Industry**: Choose the industry that best matches the candidate's background.

- **Companies**: Filter candidates based on their current or past employment at specific organizations.
