To ensure you're selecting the most relevant candidates, it's essential to apply specific vetting criteria after sourcing. By defining and categorizing criteria as 'must-have' or 'good-to-have,' you can streamline the selection process and focus on what truly matters.

It's important to be aware of the various types of criteria available that needs to be used appropriately to ensure quality screening:

- **Certifications**: Define criteria related to specific certification requirements necessary for the role.

- **Company Intelligence**: Define criteria based on key company attributes, such as revenue, funding, and other business insights.

  - **Example**: *"Candidate should have worked at a company that raised $10 million USD in a Series A round."*
  - Any criteria related to company revenue, funding, or insights should be categorized under **Company Intelligence**. These insights are powered by Crunchbase's API for accurate and up-to-date company data.

- **Educational Background**: Establish criteria regarding the candidate’s educational qualifications and relevant academic achievements.

- **Job Title**: Assess whether the candidate’s current or previous job titles align with the role’s expectations.

- **Location**: Verify the candidate’s location and proximity to ensure it meets the geographical preferences for the role

- **Skills**: Specify the required skills and competencies the candidate must possess to qualify for the position.

- **Work Experience**: Assess a candidate’s past or current work experience to determine its relevance to the role.

  - **Example**: *"Candidate should have 3 years of experience working in a SaaS-based company."*
  - Criteria like this should be tagged under **Work Experience** since it involves both the number of years and specific company-related details like industry.

- **Years of Experience**: Specify the required number of years a candidate must have spent in relevant roles.

  - **Example**: *"Candidate should have at least 2 years of experience in their last role."*
  - This criterion should be categorized under **Years of Experience** when it pertains only to tenure, without requiring company-related insights.
