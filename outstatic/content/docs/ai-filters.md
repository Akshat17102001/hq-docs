To ensure you're selecting the most relevant candidates, it's essential to apply specific vetting criteria after sourcing. By defining and categorizing criteria as 'must-have' or 'good-to-have,' you can streamline the selection process and focus on what truly matters.

It's important to be aware of the various types of criteria available that needs to be used appropriately to ensure quality screening:

- **Certifications**: Define criteria related to specific certification requirements necessary for the role.

- **Company Intelligence**: Set criteria based on key company attributes, such as revenue, funding, and other relevant organizational factors.

- **Educational Background**: Establish criteria regarding the candidate’s educational qualifications and relevant academic achievements.

- **Job Title**: Assess whether the candidate’s current or previous job titles align with the role’s expectations.

- **Location**: Verify the candidate’s location and proximity to ensure it meets the geographical preferences for the role

- **Skills**: Specify the required skills and competencies the candidate must possess to qualify for the position.

- **Work Experience**: Evaluate the candidate’s current or past work experience to determine its relevance to the role.

- **Years of Experience**: Verify the candidate’s years of experience in relevant roles or industries to ensure they meet the required experience level.
